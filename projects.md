<h3>Intelligent-911</h3>

Intelligent-911 is a smartphone app that allows intelligent and international 911 requests and incident reporting. The solution consists of two parts: The smartphone app and the control web site.

The smartphone app allows three different requests to be sent with location data, a text message and a picture. The request will be sent to a central user team by tag type and can then be forward to local authorities. The request tags current consist of Police, Fire, or Medical.

The app also allows for a "I Saw Something" anonymous message also with location data, a text message and a picture. This message is also routed to a security team/account. It is anticipated that machine learning can be used in the future to prioritize the security pictures to allow events to be handled in real-time.

The control web site can be used for any of the tag team types: Police, Fire, Medical or Security.
