<h3><a name="logistics"></a>Logistics</h3>

The 2016 Unite for Humanity Hackathon is being held in the Conference Room 9 in the Conference Building of the United Nations. Conference Room 9 is located on the lower level as you enter the building from the Visitor Entrance on UN Plaza. This entrance is wheelchair accessible. Volunteers from the Open Camps will be at the visitor entrance on First Avenue and 46th Street with preprinted visitor passes. Please follow their directions and the directions of security stahttp://opencamps.org/code-of-conduct.html">ff for entering the facility. You will be required to pass through a security station with a bag scanner and metal detector, so be sure to allow extra time to get through security.

The main entrance is across the plaza from the visitor entrance. Upon entering the building, you may use the down stairway directly in front of the right entrance doors. Enter the Conference center at the far left. You may be required to show your pass to security.  For wheelchair access, use the elevators located on the far end of the hall and to the end of the next hall on the left. Security personnel can help you find the elevators. We plan to have directional signs, and floor plans are available near the elevators and throughout the conference center. Conference Room 9 is the farthest room on the floor from the main entrance.

At the start of both Saturday and Sunday, event volunteers will be stationed outside the entrance of the conference center and will be available for questions. Throughout the event, staff and volunteers will be available to attendees.

<h3><a name="conduct"></a>Open Camps Code of Conduct</h3>

In order to foster a productive and welcoming environment for this hackathon, we request that all participants read the <a href="Open Camps Code of Conduct</a> for the event.

<h3><a name="challenges"></a>Challenges</h3>

Unite for Humanity is a two-day hackathon focused on the use of open source technologies to address humanitarian issues and pursue the UN's <a href="http://globalgoals.org/">GlobalGoals</a>. The Unite for Humanity Hackathon strives to create solutions to some of our worlds most pressing problems.

Counter Terrorism Messaging<br>
Humana Khan, Executive Director of Muflefun.org<br>
Mubin Shaikh, Counterterrorism Expert
Create a solution that will sway potential sympathizers of ISIS or al-qaeda from joining the group. Focus on message and use of technology and innovation. Focus on intervention. Do NOT create anything that will disrupt, interdict or destroy their own messaging systems. 

Additional challenges from the following groups may be presented:

DOable (climate change)<br>
Presenter: Sonia Hamel from DOable<br>
http://doable.org/

Stem Volunteering Platform<br>
Presenter from CSNYC or ScriptEd

Our July 10 Kickoff attendees suggested a number of potential projects to address these challenges. We have compiled a list of suggestions at <a href"https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/Uniteforhumanity">https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/Uniteforhumanity</a>. If any of these projects appeal to you, look for the team leader who suggested them.

<b>Prompts</b>

These are big challenges to tackle so we’ve borrowed some prompts from New York Public Library’s hack events to stimulate conversations and project ideas!

<b>Discover</b>: What new experiences can we make around UN Sustainable Development Goals?<br>
<b>Find</b>: How can we make it easier to search for information related to the SDGs?<br>
<b>Listen</b>: What are some meaningful ways we can augment the experience of communicating needs within affected communities?<br>
<b>Share</b>: How can we make it easier to share information and resources?<br>
<b>Learn</b>: What can we learn from the UN SDG? How can what we build be used in an educational context?<br>
<b>Engage</b>: How can we engage diverse and disperse communities in solving problems?<br>
<b>Access</b>: How can we make available resources more usable for people with disabilities?


<h3><a name="judging"></a>Judging Criteria and Prizes</h3>

How creative is the solution? How innovative is the solution?<br>
How easy is it for a user to understand and navigate it?<br>
How much of it works? How usable is it? 

<b>Points</b>

Up to 5 points will be awarded for each:  

  Idea: creativity of solution and implementation

  Design: Ease of use and interaction

  functionality: how much of it actually works Or close to it? 

Up to 10 points will be awarded for: 

  Potential: How likely is it for this solution to be  used. 

<h3><a name="materials"></a>Materials and Resources</h3>

We are gathering a list of tools and data we can use during the Hackathon. If you know of any good resources, or learned some during the Open Camps that you would like to share, feel free to post to <a href="https://gitter.im/aminethedream/UniteForHumanity">Gitter</a>.

<h3><a name="chat"></a>Chat & Social Media</h3>

We set up an instance of Slack for use during the event and immediately hit invitation restrictions. We are now using Gitter: <a href="https://gitter.im/aminethedream/UniteForHumanity">https://gitter.im/aminethedream/UniteForHumanity</a>. For those of you not familiar with Gitter, it’s a chatroom like Slack that allows group and 1-on-1 conversations. To use the event Gitter, just log in with your Github or Twitter credentials.

The hashtag for our event is #uniteforhumanity. Please use it to tag your tweets, Instagrams & other posts related to the event!

<h3><a name="github"></a>New to Git or Github?</h3>

Git is a file control system that lets people share and contribute to projects (called “repositories”), most of them software projects (but some people use it for other things, like taco recipes). Github (the website you are on now) is a company that allows anyone to host public Git projects for free.

We will use Git and Github to share the projects made during the Open Audio Weekend. If you're not a programmer, don't worry, sharing files in Github is as easy as dragging and dropping files to your browser! For a quick introduction on creating and updating a repository on Github, read the Creating a Repository (make sure the repository you create is Public), Adding a File to a Repository, and Editing Files in your Repository tutorials. There are more examples in the Github help. There is also this great introductory tutorial on how to become an open-source software contributor via Github by Ashley Blewer.

Event volunteers will be on hand during the event to help out.

IMPORTANT: All code you submit in the Unite for Humanity Hackathon should go to repositories you create in the Unite for Humanity Organization. Make sure your repositories are public.


<h3><a name="sharing"></a>Sharing Your Project</h3>

Every team will present their project at the end of Day 2. As described above, every project will have its own repository.

Make sure your project includes a README: select “Initialize this repository with a README” when creating the repository and then edit the file or just add a README.md file later (it is just a regular text file with the .md file extension instead of .txt).

Add this information to your README: project name, team members, project description, and links to all external assets (those outside of the repository). Make sure to take advantage of Github's text formatting toolbar.

If your project is an app (web or otherwise), make sure to include screenshots.
Depending on your type of project you may add additional files so you can present and share your project. Ask any of the volunteers if you have any questions on how to use Github.

During the final shareout you will use this repository and README as launchpad for your presentation. All projects will be presented from the same computer which will be connected to the projector so make sure to have all the necessary links in there!
